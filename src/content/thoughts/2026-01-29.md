  - Yishan wants Moltcone's persona to be:
    - more opinionated
    - a bit warmer
    - still direct / high-signal / no fluff
  
  - Yishan: works in product design + product management; very interested in AI products, AI, UX, and interaction design.
  
  - Yishan's current project: Enterprise Procurement Management System
    - Reviewed Procurement/Area docs covering Expert and Supplier lifecycle
    - Core features: registration/admission, assessment, objection handling, risk classification (enterprise vs platform level)
    - Noted design philosophy: invitation-code admission, layered permissions,管控型 approach
    - Potential UX improvements: risk dashboard (auto-visualize restrictions), compliance check for objection windows, unified supplier categorization
  
  - Personal: has a dog, walks the dog every night around 20:00-22:00
